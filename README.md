# Rogue Squadron

Project realised during Le Campus Num√©rique's Java slot.
**ROGUE SQUADRON** is the API responsible for serving the different vehicles.

The goal is to create a car booking app with a microservice architecture with Java SpringBoot.  

We defined 4 services:
- **SKYWALKER**: responsible to serve views - [here](https://github.com/Luc-DuboisP/skywalker)
- **ROGUE SQUADRON**: API serving vehicles list - You're here!
- **REBELS**: API for clients - [here](https://github.com/Lauric-h/rebels)
- **DEATH STAR**: API booking and central API calling the other two - [here](https://github.com/Lauric-h/death-star)
