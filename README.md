# Rogue Squadron

Project realised during Le Campus Numérique's Java slot.
**ROGUE SQUADRON** is the API responsible for serving the different vehicles.

The goal is to create a car booking app with a microservice architecture with Java SpringBoot.  

We defined 4 services:
- **SKYWALKER**: responsible to serve views 
- **ROGUE SQUADRON**: API serving vehicles list
- **REBELS**: API for clients
- **DEATH STAR**: API booking and central API calling the other two
